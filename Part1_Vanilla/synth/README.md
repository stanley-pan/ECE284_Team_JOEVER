Part1_Vanilla Synthesis Folder

Place FPGA synthesis and implementation results here.

Required files:
- `FPGA_Report.pdf` — synthesis report with measured parameters

Expected table contents (example):
- Design name
- Target FPGA device
- Logic utilization (LUTs, FFs, slices)
- Memory usage (BRAM, URAM)
- Max frequency (MHz)
- Power estimates (W)
- Area (mm²) if available

Notes:
- Use your CAD tool's native reporting (Vivado, Quartus, etc.)
- Include timing closure status and any critical paths
- Document optimization techniques used
